# AI Academic Advisor System Master Plan

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Objectives
- Create a chat-based AI academic advisor for efficient student guidance
- Ensure accurate course information without hallucination
- Provide consistent, focused responses within budget constraints
- Maintain quick response times through optimized agent architecture
- Restrict conversations to academic advising topics

### 1.2 Core Requirements
- **Accuracy**: Prevent hallucination on course information and routines
- **Speed**: Optimize response time through parallel processing
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Minimize token usage and API calls
- **Consistency**: Maintain reliable responses across interactions
- **Topic Control**: Restrict conversations to academic advising
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between agent responsibilities

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Agent Hierarchy
```

├── Query Classifier Agent
├── Department-Specific Agents
│   ├── Business Agent
│   ├── Fine Arts Agent
│   └── [Other Department Agents]
├── Validation Agent
└── Fallback Agent
```

### 2.2 Agent Roles and Responsibilities

#### Query Classifier Agent
- Primary gateway for all incoming queries
- Responsibilities:
  - Query classification (department, complexity)
  - Topic relevance verification
  - Initial response planning
- Implementation:
  ```python
  class QueryClassifier:
      async def classify(self, query: str) -> ClassificationResult:
          # Use few-shot prompting for accurate classification
          # Return department, complexity, and relevance score
  ```

#### Department Agents
- Specialized knowledge bases per department
- Responsibilities:
  - Course-specific information retrieval
  - Department-specific academic guidance
  - Prerequisite verification
- Implementation:
  ```python
  class DepartmentAgent:
      def __init__(self, department: str):
          self.vector_store = ChromaDB(department)
          self.tools = self._initialize_department_tools()
  ```

#### Validation Agent
- Ensures response accuracy and consistency
- Responsibilities:
  - Fact-checking against knowledge base
  - Response format verification
  - Consistency monitoring
- Implementation:
  ```python
  class ValidationAgent:
      async def validate_response(self, response: str, context: dict) -> ValidatedResponse:
          # Verify response against known facts
          # Check response format and consistency
  ```

### 2.3 Communication Protocol

#### Async Communication Flow
```python
async def process_query(query: str):
    # Parallel processing using asyncio.gather
    classification, relevant_docs = await asyncio.gather(
        classifier.classify(query),
        retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
    )
```

#### Inter-Agent Communication
- Use message passing with structured formats
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Track conversation state through shared context

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 RAG Implementation
```python
class RAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        self.vector_stores = self._initialize_department_stores()
        
    async def retrieve_context(self, query: str, department: str) -> List[Document]:
        # Efficient context retrieval with department-specific stores
```

### 3.2 Hallucination Prevention
1. Multiple Validation Layers:
   - Source verification against knowledge base
   - Confidence scoring for responses
   - Cross-reference checking between agents

2. Response Templates:
   ```python
   class ResponseTemplate:
       def format_response(self, content: dict) -> str:
           # Structured response formatting
           # Include source references
   ```

### 3.3 Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy
```python
class QueryCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=3600)
        
    async def get_or_compute(self, query: str, compute_fn: Callable):
        # Implement caching with TTL
```

#### Conditional Execution
```python
class ExecutionPlanner:
    async def plan_execution(self, query: str) -> ExecutionPlan:
        # Determine necessary agent calls
        # Create parallel execution plan
```

## 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 4.1 Performance Metrics
- Response time tracking
- Token usage monitoring
- Accuracy assessment
- User satisfaction metrics

### 4.2 Logging System
```python
class SystemLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = structlog.get_logger()
        
    def log_interaction(self, query: str, response: str, metrics: dict):
        # Structured logging with context
```

## 5. Security and Access Control

### 5.1 Topic Control
```python
class TopicController:
    def is_relevant(self, query: str) -> bool:
        # Check query relevance to academic advising
        # Implement topic classification
```

### 5.2 Rate Limiting
```python
class RateLimiter:
    async def check_limit(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        # Implement token bucket algorithm
        # Track usage per user
```

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Test Scenarios
1. Simple queries
2. Complex multi-department queries
3. Edge cases and error conditions
4. Performance under load

### 6.2 Automated Testing
```python
class TestSuite:
    async def run_tests(self) -> TestResults:
        # Comprehensive test suite
        # Coverage reporting
```

## 7. Deployment Plan

### 7.1 Phased Rollout
1. Initial deployment with basic functionality
2. Gradual addition of department agents
3. Performance optimization phase
4. Full system deployment

### 7.2 Monitoring and Adjustment
- Real-time performance monitoring
- User feedback collection
- Continuous system optimization

## 8. Budget Control

### 8.1 Cost Optimization
- Implement token usage tracking
- Set department-specific limits
- Use cheaper models for simple queries
- Cache frequently requested information

### 8.2 Budget Monitoring
```python
class BudgetController:
    async def track_usage(self, interaction: dict):
        # Monitor token usage
        # Generate cost reports
```
