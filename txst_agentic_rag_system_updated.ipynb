        "#Overview of Agentic RAG\n",
        "## What is RAG?\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval with generative models to produce more accurate, relevant, and contextually aware responses. Traditional language models generate responses based solely on the input prompt and their pre-trained knowledge. However, RAG systems enhance this by fetching external information from a knowledge base or documents, ensuring that responses are up-to-date and grounded in specific data sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What are AI Agents?\n",
        "AI Agents are systems or programs capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system. They design their workflows, utilize available tools, and can interact with external data sources, APIs, and other agents to solve complex tasks. In the context of RAG, AI agents can decide when and how to retrieve information, perform calculations, analyze data, and generate responses based on multiple inputs and tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agentic RAG vs. Traditional RAG\n",
        "While traditional RAG systems primarily focus on augmenting generative models with information retrieval from a vector database, Agentic RAG systems are more versatile. They can incorporate multiple tools beyond data retrieval, such as performing mathematical calculations, sending emails, conducting data analysis, and more. Additionally, agentic RAG systems can operate collaboratively in multi-agent environments, enhancing scalability and adaptability."
